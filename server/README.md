# Starting Backend Server
Entire backend logic is built using communication between Node.js and mongoDB.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

### `npm install` or `npm i`

The command npm install is used in Node.js and JavaScript development to install the dependencies listed in a project's package.json file.

Adding .env file: 

* MONGO_URL - connection to MongoDB cluster.
* JWT_SECRET - random set of strings or numbers.
* PORT - set to 5000 ( in this case ) or you can choose any other localhost
* NODE_ENV - set to development
