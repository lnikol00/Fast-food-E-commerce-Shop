# Backend - server

### `npm install` or `npm i`

The command is used in Node.js and JavaScript development to install the dependencies listed in a project's package.json file.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

The command npm run dev is typically used in a Node.js-based project to start a development server or perform other development-related tasks. Here's what this command does:

* npm: This is the Node Package Manager, which is used to manage and install packages and dependencies for Node.js projects.
* run: This is a subcommand of npm that is used to execute a script defined in your project's package.json file.
* dev: This is the name of the script you want to run. The name "dev" is a common convention, but you can name your scripts as you see fit.

Adding .env file: 

* MONGO_URL - connection to MongoDB cluster.
* JWT_SECRET - random set of strings or numbers.
* PORT - set to 5000 ( in this case ) or you can choose any other localhost
* NODE_ENV - set to development
